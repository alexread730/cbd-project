          <h4>Welcome to Lunacy Indexer</h4>
          <h5>How crazy we talkin'?</h5>
          <p>Do you believe in werewolves? Vampires? Have you ever heard someone say that weird things  happen because of the full moon? Belief in the “lunar effect” has persisted over the centuries  -- the Roman goddess of the moon bore a name that remains familiar to us today: Luna, which also happens to be the prefix of the word “lunatic.” It is now generally accepted that mythology once served a central role in human life, up until the time when science and industry somehow stole away or otherwise replaced our myths, but many ancient myths have followed us into the modern age. Many continue to believe in the “lunar effect,” sometimes called the "Transylvania Effect," can inspire craziness, motivate risky behaviors and set the stage for an otherworldly wild night. Some police officers and staff in hospital emergency departments insist that there are more accidents, violent incidents and psychiatric admissions when the moon is full. In 2007, the police force in the British seaside resort of Brighton even went as far as to employ extra officers during full moon. Can we use data analysis to predict just how crazy it is out there?</p>
